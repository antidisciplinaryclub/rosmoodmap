Literally how I got introduced to you, 'I have a friend and she's amazing, she is also into Kali and these things, I guess you guys will connect well, you two should definitely meet', paraphrasing Michelle. Andddd, voila! My Kali energy in flesh! <3

You know what your presence does? At least in my case, giving me child-like joy, excitement and comfort. You become the space where anybody could be anything they want to be! But hey, you're also such a cat! Swinging by, silently observing, deducing and knowing exactly where to put how much of what! Also, the funniest, without even trying!

There's mad respect for who you choose to be, what you do and what you keep striving for. Okay, I'm getting emotional typing this out. I see you. I see you in the ways you constantly try to give to your people and community at large. You are a master, not the one going around claiming or flaunting their proficiency or skills or knowledge but that wise one- the one that enables, nurtures, supports, the one that sees and hears, the one that shares the path and shows the vision. You are that, you are a guru. In the spiritual tradition I lean towards, a guru holds a place of the highest order after earning it. You hold that place in my life. Beyond all that we are co-creating and striving for, I love you for who you are. Thank you for existing, for sharing love, the good and light in this world. You give me hope and with you, I feel like I could even change the world order. We shall do that too before we say Hi to Death and swing by in that realm, lol. 

Happiest Birthday to you, Ro! Here's to more art, realms, representation, revolution, possibilities, stories, emotions, love, joy and a million other crazy things worth living! Lead us like the Sun in every universe! May the world hold space for you and your gifts! Love and Respect! <3`

        message: `Dear Ro,

I’m not really sure what I wanted to say in this letter, but I felt like I needed to write. I guess you could say I’m the kind of person who writes a lot of letters to friends, so I figured it was bound to happen eventually. I’m honestly glad Ananya made me sit down and do it. It feels good to put my thoughts into words.

First off, I just want to tell you that I think you’re an amazing person. You’re so kind, so talented, and you’ve got this rare ability to always be open to learning. That’s something a lot of us in the queers lack. We get defensive, or we hide behind a tough exterior because we’ve had to fight so hard in the world. But you? You’re like a sweet, grounded lesbian flower who looks out for her friends. And it blows my mind that we’ve known each other for two years now!

When I think about our friendship and how much it’s grown, I can’t help but think back to the hardest year of my life. You were there when my dad passed and when my dog died. That year was rough, and I even lost a lot of friends because I couldn’t be myself. I couldn’t be happy. But you? You stuck around. You came through for me, even when you didn’t have to. I’ll never be able to fully express how much that meant to me. You were a constant when everything felt like it was falling apart.

I remember that time at your party when everyone was shouting “Fuck you, dad” Without even thinking, I said it too. And then it hit me, my dad’s gone. But I laughed so hard, and you got it. You understood why I laughed. You knew it wasn’t just about the words. It was about finding a way to deal with the pain and still laugh about it also our dads are assholes right.... death don't absolve shit. That meant a lot to me... we just the same type of broken because of our narcissistic dads.

One thing I really admire about you is the way you’ve learned to trust yourself, especially when it comes to your art. You’re brave, and you express yourself so openly. You’ve built this confidence that I really aspire to have in my own life. I want to be able to trust my abilities the way you do, and I hope I can get there one day.

We’re Both Fucked Up, But At Least We’re Not Alone

I love our conversations about art and science. Every time we talk, I feel like I’m learning something new. It’s not just about the knowledge, though. It’s about the way you open up my world. You introduce me to so many great people, and that’s something I really value. Meeting the people you love has been so eye-opening because they’re just as good as you are. And that’s why I value our friendship so much. You’ve shown me a new way of looking at things, and I hope you keep bringing these amazing people into my life.

I think one of the reasons we connect so well is because we share the same dark sense of humor. We laugh at the mess of life more than we take it seriously, and it helps us both deal with everything that comes our way. Honestly, I feel like I’ve opened up to you more than anyone else, all while laughing about how messed up life can be.

Anyway, I guess what I’m saying is you’re kind of like my favorite emotional support person without the official therapy license. But hey, at least you’re not charging me by the hour :P Let’s keep surviving, thriving, and laughing at how ridiculous everything is because we both know life is a joke, and we’re just in on it and not like we can die together, or can we?

I really hope I bring the light into your life like you have..... I am always here for you, promise!


Love 
Mojo Jojo :*`

        message: `Dear ro
I am in ur room and ur out there somewhere doing something. Being helpful to someone else. 
I know there’s a lot to do, there really is an awful lot to do. I miss you every time, especially when you have to do these excursions of yours on the weekend. Its like I’m waiting for my husband to come back from war.
But I am so deeply in love with that side of you and I honestly wouldn’t have it any other way.
I am so glad we get to plan this life together, the thought of me planning my life with you adds more colour to it in a very literal way. 
You keep trying to convince me about your introvertedness or shyness, but you are so much more open to the world than you make yourself out to be. I wish you could understand the respect and love with which so many people, so many important people, see you. Just seeing these letters I’ve received so far from your friends for this — its not like they just wrote a hey hi happy birthday situation and called it a day, it’s always a whole manifesto about the kind of person you are to them. And even if its a short write up, it’s some kind of reference to a very specific part of your friendship, or some kind of double meaning — its like even the shortness of the letter speaks to something super specific about you, you know what I mean?
I think you are a marvel of a person. They few people that do know you are overwhelmingly lucky to get to know you. Before you came along, I was looking so hard for what to do. I know what to do now, my locer. I have a planner full of things to do with you.
LOCE YOU AND HOCEY BOCE DOCE`

It is your birthday today and you’ll be 27 for a whole year now. Congratulations.
Your prefrontal cortex has fully developed. You’re finally settling into the person you’ve inevitably become. 
Take a moment to take this in. Are you pleased? I think you should be extremely pleased with the person you’ve become. 
In case you’re not extremely pleased, here are a few things that could make being 27 easier:
1.⁠ ⁠Cake. Any and all kinds of cake will make you happy from now on. Even the bad ones, because you’ll appreciate that at the very least, it’s sweet, just like it promised it would be.
2.⁠ ⁠Videos of dogs reuniting with their owners. Even though you’re a cat person, you’ll cry to these videos. But in a nice cathartic way. 
3.⁠ ⁠Pillows with lumbar support. You’ll start to smile in a whole new way when your back is supported correctly. It won’t be the smile of youth or adventure, but one of deep adult gratitude.
4.⁠ ⁠Pouches that can carry everything you’ll need. You’ll need things now. Like antacids, ORS, ear buds. One day you will look into your bag and realise you’ve carried a small but impressive medical store. It will make you happy.
5.⁠ ⁠Early bedtimes. Early bedtimes will start to mean more to you than it reasonably should. Your day will be better when you realise you’ve just slept for 8 hours. They get rarer and more precious. Savour them, they won’t always be this good.
Be prepared to receive an updated list on your 28th birthday, at which point ergonomic footwear will feature more prominently.
Love,
Nid`

I totally did not expect to be a recurring character in your life after u dropped ur MFA 🥲 but im very glad you invited me into your collective of incredible individuals. You make every environment so much more special- I treasure all the time spent in your presence from watching that damn Ghoda fall apart coming down the stairs, to the warmth of your jams & practices thru the walls of my bedroom. Keep being u and you’ll always be that ingredient that makes every meal taste fiyaaa 👅 

May our paths cross many more times

I was kind of pumped to discover somebody else had an email id too, and I was a little excited to make friends with someone from across the aisle (section A). No idea what we yapped about but Cawas def told us to keep quiet at least once and then when you did write the first email that I remember, it was signed off “Rohini the Great,” which I really humorously turned back on you as “Rohini the Grape”… v clever. 
We did a lot of emailing and G-chatting in the middle, with Jeevika and Aman and Anvita, and you told me to listen to Chicken Fried by Zac Brown Band, told me what Glee and Defying Gravity were, and actually those are the only coherent bits I remember from the emails.
This is supposed to be about the history of email through the lens of us as school children but I must also mention that one time we saw a comic strip from Pearls Before Swine and we lost our collective minds. You drew a few of your own also. Something in there about feral ballerinas. 
We graduated to Teen Angst emails in like the eighth grade, but I hate this time and will not talk about it. We wrote a song. Which is to say that I wrote 8 lines as a parasitic second verse to your already banging song. I cannot believe I was fourteen once. I found it really gross that you and Anvita were kissing boys btw. (Even back then, I stood for what was right).

I’ve seen so many versions of you, and while you’re still as goofy and unproblematic as ever, you’ve become more confident and open, and it’s a character arc the audience (me) has loved seeing. At the same time though, it’s so nice to know that despite everything you’ve been through, you still believe in the best in people. I think it is such an important quality to have.
It is also objectively admirable that so many of your goals involve doing things for the world around you. Even outside of your many projects, I think your instinct is to give. It might sound stupid to say that you have great critical thinking skills and empathy but I cannot emphasise how rare those things are, let alone in combination. You care about all the right things. I don’t want this to sound like a report card assessment, but it’s an A+ from me.
You have such warmth and congeniality, and I hope the people you choose to engage with give you the space and support to cultivate it.
Don’t let people take advantage of you. Scam call aaye, toh cut karne ka. Remember that sometimes the spam caller is your father. Aur yeh yaad rakho ki jo bhi ho - masti nahi rukni chahiye.
I hope that everything you give the world, it offers back to you.

I think it’s been like 8 years or more that we’ve hung out, but our 8th grade memories are still something I hold so close to my heart. You had the worst influence on me in the best of ways - it was so hilarious running away from history class to hang out in the lawn with your ukulele, and even more outrageously fun to almost fail math with miss Monica coz we just kept laughing in the front bench. But you also had the best influence on me in the best of ways - I mean I was in band coz of you even though I was deathly shy of performing in front of anyone! 

You were the funniest, funnest and most original person I’d ever met (you still probably are, sorry for the past tense) and I genuinely had the best times with you. So even though it’s been a hella long time since high school, I will always have so much love for you. 

I’m sure you’re doing amazing and I hope you have the best bday (this bday gift is so cool and creative btw)! 

Love, 
Anvita`

        message: `as i write this i'm going through all the notes i jot down in the little notebook you gifted me before i left for vienna; a lot of it is to-do lists, grocery lists, some very empathetic pleas to myself to get my shit together. but some of it is also doodles, observations about the world around me, art references, things i liked, things that inspired me. i think you (our whole friend group but mostly you) have been the driving force behind me getting my creativity and joy back. watching you make art so freely and with so much fervour has been both a joy for me and a motivation to follow suit. it's very rare to come across someone who knows themselves so well or at least knows who they want to be. to see you be so unapologetically yourself no matter what is incredibly beautiful and i'm  excited to see how much more you can create and do with your talent and sheer enthusiasm. thank u for being such a cool friend <333
